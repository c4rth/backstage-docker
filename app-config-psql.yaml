  # Note that the baseUrl should be the URL that the browser and other clients
  # should use when communicating with the backend, i.e. it needs to be
  # reachable not just from within the backend host, but from all of your

  # and can't be reached by others.

  # all interfaces, the most permissive setting. The right value depends on your specific deployment.
